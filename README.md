# hello-world
My first repository

hi all, i first coded basic in my teens, loved it but ended up recruiting developers and tech execs for a living.
i never lost my love of the logic, problem solving and limitless potential of coding though so after much procrastination i'm back hoping to learn to code properly this time and build some cool stuff, maybe even something useful to the world
